## Read data

The data are drawn from the ‚ÄúTidy Tuesday‚Äù project: [2021 Week 43: Big
Pumpkins](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-10-19/readme.md)
(credit:
[BigPumpkins.com](http://www.bigpumpkins.com/ViewArticle.asp?id=132),
providing data from the [Great Pumpkin
Commonwealth](https://gpc1.org/)).

``` r
pumpkins <- read_csv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-10-19/pumpkins.csv"
)
```

## Which countries?

Let‚Äôs find out which countries submit the most entries to these
competitions. Our first attempt at making a bar graph will‚Ä¶ not look
good! But it will give us some information about the data.

``` r
pumpkins %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = country)) +
  geom_bar()
```

Yikes. Firstly, there seem to be a lot of nonsense ‚Äúcountries‚Äù which
begin either with numbers or with brackets, which we can inspect by
running the code below in R itself (it‚Äôs set not to evaluate in this
document).

``` r
pumpkins %>%
  filter(!str_detect(country, "^[[:alpha:]]")) %>%
  #Finds countries that don't start with a letter %>%
  View()
```

These rows just have the same thing repeated, which appears to be some
sort of incorrectly-parsed header row. They all begin with digits, so we
can exclude such ‚Äúcountries‚Äù when we clean the dataset.

We can also notice by using the `glimpse` function‚Ä¶

``` r
glimpse(pumpkins)
```

‚Ä¶that some of the numeric columns have been parsed as character, because
when `readr` was reading in the data they still had the text strings in
them. We need to change those to numeric, and we should use the
`parse_number` function from `readr` to do this because it handles the
thousands-separating commas nicely [1] (whereas base R‚Äôs `as.numeric`
function produces `NA`s for these).

There are a couple of other changes we might like to make: ‚ÄúUnknown
country‚Äù would be handled more sensibly by R if we had that as `NA`, and
typicaly datasets call the country north of Belgium and west of Germany
‚ÄúNetherlands‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúThe Netherlands‚Äù.

``` r
pumpkins_cleaned <- pumpkins %>%
  filter(!str_detect(country, "^\\d")) %>%
  #Removes country names that start with a digit
  mutate(
    country = case_when(
      country == "Unknown country" ~ NA_character_,
      #`NA` here produces an error!
      country == "The Netherlands" ~ "Netherlands",
      TRUE                         ~ country
    ),
    weight_lbs = parse_number(weight_lbs),
    ott = parse_number(ott),
    est_weight = parse_number(est_weight),
    pct_chart = parse_number(pct_chart)
  ) 
```

Right, let‚Äôs have another go at that bar chart.

``` r
pumpkins_cleaned %>%
  filter(!is.na(country)) %>%
  mutate(
    country = country %>%
      fct_infreq() %>%
      fct_rev()
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = country)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(
    x = "Number of entries",
    y = "Country",
    title = "All my life‚Ä¶",
    subtitle = "‚Ä¶ there's pumpkins in America",
    caption = "Source: BigPumpkins.com/GPC"
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = comma) +
  #This is the `comma` function from the `scales` package.
  #We could also write
  # scale_x_continuous(labels = label_comma()) +
  #which more easily lets us set any further options, should we wish to
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r = 6))) #Nudge label left
```

üí° *What happens if we swap the last two lines of code around? (Taking
care to put the plus in the right place, of course.) What does this tell
us about the interaction between `theme_minimal` and `theme`?* üí°

Seems like the US is the prime country for the growing of these
pumpkins. But which states? Let‚Äôs find out.

## Which states?

All fifty states are represented in this dataset.

``` r
pumpkins_usa <- pumpkins_cleaned %>% #Remember to use the cleaned dataset!
  filter(country == "United States")

pumpkins_usa %>%
  summarise(num_states = n_distinct(state_prov))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##   num_states
    ##        <int>
    ## 1         50

``` r
pumpkins_usa %>%
  mutate(
    state_prov = state_prov %>%
      fct_infreq() %>%
      fct_lump_n(n = 21) %>%
      fct_rev()
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = state_prov)) +
  geom_bar()
```

![](pumpkins_files/figure-gfm/which-states-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
large_states <- pumpkins_usa %>%
  group_by(state_prov) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_wt = mean(weight_lbs, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()
  ) %>%
  filter(n >= 50) %>%
  pull(state_prov)

pumpkins_usa %>%
  filter(state_prov %in% large_states) %>%
  mutate(
    state_prov = state_prov %>%
      fct_reorder(weight_lbs, mean)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = weight_lbs, y = state_prov)) +
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.7)
```

[1] `parse_number` assumes you are in the US, which, like the UK, uses
`.` to separate the integer and fraction parts of a number, and `,` to
separate thousands in groups of three. You can use `parse_number`‚Äôs
`locale` argument, together with the `locale` *function*, to specify an
alternate behaviour.
